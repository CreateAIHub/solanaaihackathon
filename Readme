# Project Overview
This project provides a decision-making agent for the Solana blockchain. It processes user queries to either access a knowledge base, perform a token swap, or collect more details.

## Installation
Use `requirements.txt` to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Locally
Start the FastAPI server from main.py:

## Deployment
See render.yaml for a sample Render service configuration. It defines the build and start commands for deployment.

## Structure
• The main application entry point is main.py.
• Routing is configured in chat.py.
• API configuration is in config.py.
• The decision logic resides in DecisionMaker.
• Handlers for different actions are in action_handler.py.

## Usage
Send a POST request to “/api/v1/chat” with a JSON body containing a “query” string.
The system uses DecisionMaker to decide whether to invoke knowledge base lookups or token swap logic.
Token swaps rely on the file coin_list.txt to fetch mint addresses.
